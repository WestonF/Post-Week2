This actually took significantly longer than most of the prior operations. I'm not certain why, but may be bound up in the increased number of function calls executed? Additionally, there are two occasions on which join is called on all active threads, so if even one thread is slow, the whole program has two opportunities to grind to a halt.
Its also possible that this structuring was less compatible with the underlying system's virtualization, forcing it to operate more explicitly as written in the program instead of finding ways to run fragments of the program on whatever resources the system could throw at it.
